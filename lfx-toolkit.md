Linux Foundation is a technology association of several companies that helps to scale open source projects. Linux Foundation provides platforms to support the sustainability of the open source ecosystem by providing various services, events, and training.

# What is LFX?
LFX is a suite of tools built by the Linux Foundation to facilitate every aspect of open source development. The toolkit operationalizes the organizationâ€™s proven methodology for transforming projects into category leaders, providing direct support to projects and empowering open source developers to write better, more secure code and grow sustainable ecosystems.
With 11 tools currently available and more on the roadmap for early next year, the LFX toolkit is one of the most comprehensive platforms built specifically for the open technology ecosystem.

# Why was LFX created?
The world runs on open source, and projects need more than a version or source control system to scale. The Linux Foundation has evolved a proven methodology to transform projects into category leaders. LFX operationalizes this approach, providing a suite of tools built to facilitate every aspect of open source development.
